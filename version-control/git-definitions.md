# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

The method of tracking changes to a project.  I expect it is essential for trouble-shooting and if there is a need to return a project to a previous state.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a state of the project or code.  The master or main branch is the current approved state.  The feature branches allow trial and error work on additions to be done without affecting the master until finished, checked and merged.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit command is run when files that have been created or modified are ready, after being staged, to be added to a branch.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when in an attempt to merge two branches a given file has been modified in both, creating confusion as to which version the merged branch should contain.
