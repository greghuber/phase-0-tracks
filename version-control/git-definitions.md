# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is basically a timeline of changes done to an existing project. By utilizing version control, one can understand when certain changes were made and can revert to a previous version - like a save point.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

Branching allows different changes to be made without affecting the master copy. This technique allows for multiple changes simultaneously, from different sources.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is literally a save point, where the changes one has made are finalized in the copy of the code. After commiting, the code can be copied from the branch to the master copy. A commit message will describe what exactly makes this version of the code different from the master version.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when there are differing items that need to be merged. A merge works only if something is added, or deleted - but will not combine terms.
