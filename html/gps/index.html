What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?

-Semantic tags are used for directing code within the website itself. This is code that is not visible on the outside, but is generally responsible for how it looks and reacts. The most useful semantic tag would probably be title, which names the URL for the page.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

-In decending order; priority from h1 to h6. I guess I'm not entirely sure what this question is asking. In the body the order is typically header, main, and footer.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

-I had no idea you could create a custom snippet, this will definitely save me time in the future when building pages - not neccessarily just those that are HTML. Although, I do want to spend time learning the format before I use shortcuts. 

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?

-The most difficult part of this challenge for me at least, was the table creation. I need to practice the syntax of that tag, and then I think I'll be okay. Really enjoyed the GPS this week!
