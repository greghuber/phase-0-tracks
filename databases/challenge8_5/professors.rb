# PROFESSORS PAGE
#
# Allow professors to log in, then enter grades for as many students as they choose.
#
# Upon professor inputting each student's grades, add a row to the 'grades' table
#   in the 'grade_data' database linked to the student and the course tables.

# Include hashes of professors and their access codes as well as 
#   courses and their course numbers to validate the professors access and
#   ease their data entry.
# Include array of 'valid grades' to test input, and set the validity of the
#   professor and both grades to false until proven otherwise.
