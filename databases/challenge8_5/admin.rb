# Create database to store and connect students, their courses and their grades.
# 		STUDENTS table will store name, year in school, status in "good standing",
# 		password granting them limited access to their grades
# 		COURSES table will store course name, professor, and number of students
# 		GRADES table will be a junction table , and will store grades for 
#  		semesters 1 & 2 and id links to the STUDENTS and COURSES tables 
#
# Create methods and write user code to allow administrators to perform the following:
#  		CREATE, UPDATE & DELETE student records.
#  		CREATE, UPDATE & DELETE course records.

#    ASSUMPTIONS MADE / NEXT THINGS TO ADDRESS:
# 1) Administrators can be trusted to enter data with no security concerns
# 2) Grades of 'E' are the only reason for a student to fall out of 'good_standing'
# 3) No one is looking over the student's shoulder as they enter their password
# 4) In professor's grade entry, selective admissions policy prevents two students sharing a name
# 5) Impressive professor hiring guarentees they enter their course numbers accurately
