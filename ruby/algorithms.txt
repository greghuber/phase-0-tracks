# ROBOT /ELEVATOR ALGORITHM

	#Approach the up and down buttons near elevator doors
	
	#Ask Master for the desired floor
	
	#If the desired floor number is greater than the current floor, 
	#and if the up button is not already lit, press the up button
	#Or if the desired floor number is less than the current floor, 
	#and if the down button is not already lit, press the down button
	#Or, if the desired floor is the current floor, tell Master that
	
	#When the desired up/down light becomes lit by one elevator
	#Move toward and enter that elevator's doors when they open
	
	#Find panel with buttons for floors
	#Position self within reach of buttons
	
	#While people are entering the elevator, press OPEN DOORS button
	
	#If anyone but Master is in the elevator, ask them what floor they desire
		
		#For each requested floor, 
		#Locate the button with that number on it or next to it.
		#if requested floor number appears on panel, and its indicator is not already lit, press button for that floor
		
		#Otherwise, say that building doesn't have that floor
		#Repeat until four seconds go by without a valid floor request, or until the number of 	buttons pressed is equal to the number of humans in the elevator (so some kid doesn't call 	out all the floors in a highrise)
	
	#If the button for Master's desired floor is on the panel and its button is not lit, 
	#press that floor's button
	#Otherwise, if the number appears but is lit, do nothing,
	#Otherwise, tell Master that building doesn't have that floor, and request another floor number
	#Repeat until Master suggests a valid floor or suggests you two leave quickly
	#If Master suggests you two leave quicly, follow him off the elevator


# DRIVING TO THE GROCERY STORE ALGORITHM

	#Continue until proceeding will cause you to hit an object or person

		#If car not running, start ignition
		#If no cars within 75 yards are moving toward driveway, and no pedestrians or animals within 50 feet are moving toward driveway, back out of driveway, position car headed west
		
		#Proceed on road to stop sign, slow and stop at sign, turn on left turn indicator
		
		#If any cars at other three stop signs arrived first, wait until no longer true
		#Proceed, turning left and heading south
		
		#When 25 yards from stop light...
		#If light is green, proceed forward,
		#If light is yellow, acclerate and proceed forward,
		#Otherwise, stop at stop line, remain stopped until light is green, then proceed forward
		
		#When entrance to Jewel is 25 yards away, slow down, turn on left turn indicator and turn left into parking lot
			
		#Repeat until an open parking space is found
			#Turn left into next row of parking spaces, proceed until space on either side is 	unoccupied, then pull into that space.
			#If no space is unoccupied in the the current row, turn right at the end of the row and right again into the next row, repeating the process of evaluating spaces
			##If no space is unoccupied in the current row, turn left at the end of the row

		#Once parked in space, turn off ignition
