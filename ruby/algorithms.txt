#Approach the up and down buttons near elevator doors

#Ask Master for the desired floor

#If the desired floor number is greater than the current floor, 
#and if the up button is not already lit, press the up button
#Or if the desired floor number is less than the current floor, 
#and if the down button is not already lit, press the down button
#Or, if the desired floor is the current floor, tell Master that

#When the desired up/down button becomes unlit
#Locate the elevator doors with a corresponding up/down light lit
#Move toward and enter that elevator's doors when they open

#Find panel with buttons for floors
#Position self within reach of buttons

#As long as people are entering the elevator, press OPEN DOORS button

#If anyone but Master is in the elevator, ask them what floor they desire
	
#For each requested floor, 
#Locate the button with that number on it or next to it.
#if requested floor number appears on panel, and is not already lit, press button for that floor

#Otherwise, say that building doesn't have that floor
#Repeat until four seconds go by without a valid floor request, or until the number of buttons pressed is equal to the number of humans in the elevator (so some kid doesn't call out all the floors in a highrise)

#If the button for Master's desired floor is on the panel and its button is not lit, 
#press that floor's button
#Otherwise, if the number appears but is lit, do nothing,
#Otherwise, tell Master that building doesn't have that floor, and request another floor number
#Repeat until Master suggests a valid floor or suggests you two leave quickly
#If Master suggests you two leave quicly, follow him off the elevator
