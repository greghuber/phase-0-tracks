# DESIGN A CLASS: BICYCLE which must have...
#
# at least 3 ATTRIBUTES (using at least two data types) whose values 
# will vary from instance to instance (example: age):
# color (string), age (integer), functional (boolean) &
# bling (array of strings),
#
# and at least 3 METHODS, at least one of which takes an argument:
# paint_job (change color, takes new_color as parameter), add_bling 
# (takes new_bling), plus_year (increment age, no parameter) &
# mechanic (change status of functionality, no parameter)
#__________________________________________________________

# Initialize new instance with parameters color and bling as input.
# Set age to '0' and functionality to 'true' by default

# Similarly, allow color and bling read/write priviledges to outside of
# class, but age and functionality read only.

# bike's age one year, then prints the new status of the bike's age.

# entering or leaving a shop, that is was working, now is not, or 
# vice versa, then prints the new status of the bike's functionality.
